## üí° About  
pluGET is a standalone package manager written in python for minecraft [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/) servers and its forks (e.g. [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/)). The program works with a locally installed servers or with a remote host through SFTP/FTP, when configured in the config. It uses multiple APIs to download and compare plugin versions from [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/), and [GitHub](https://github.com/) repositories. It can also compare and download the latest update of specific server software (e.g. [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/)).

Plugin management is the hard part of managing a minecraft server. The time it takes to manually check the [Spigot resources](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/) page for updates and manually downloading all plugins is too long and daunting. So I built pluGET to automate and ease the plugin handling of a minecraft server and to turn the most time consuming part of managing a minecraft server to an easy one.

This program is suited for minecraft server owners who want to save time and stay on top of their plugin versions. The program input and the associated config file are pretty simple so every server owner and not only the most tech savy ones can use pluGET to ease their plugin handling.

## ‚õî Known problems

### Can't get latest version/Update available

#### Inconsistent Names and Versions
Example:
![EssentialsX](https://i.ibb.co/fDyCYQ8/essentialsx.png)  
EssentialsX is a prominent example of inconsisten version naming. The installed version is `2.18.2.0` but on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/essentialsx.9089/update?update=371379) the version is only described as `2.18.2`.  
That's the reason pluGET can't detect it automatically.  
> There are of course many more plugins which have some sort of inconsistency which makes it sadly impossible for pluGET to detect them all. EssentialsX is used only as an example.  

#### Solution
Download the plugins with the `get [pluginName]` command to make them detectable for pluGET.  
After downloading EssentialsX with `get EssentialsX` and using `check all`:  
![EssentialsX](https://i.ibb.co/ws5wHTj/essentialsx-2.png)  
EssentialsX is now detected from pluGET and can update automatically when a new version comes out.  

### Bukkit plugins
Example:  
![worldguard](https://i.ibb.co/7NJ9HRG/pluget-checkallonlyone.png)  
As you can see the installed version was found but not the latest version for this plugin.  
This is because this is a plugin which is not available on [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/).
pluGET supports currently only plugins from [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/).  
In this example this is a bukkit plugin.
